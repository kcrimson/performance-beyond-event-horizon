if you don't believe climate crisis is real +
and caused by humans +
you will not like this presentation

you can stay and accept consequences +
or you can leave, it is your choice

=== !

I cannot take responsibility for your feelings +
(this is what I call freedom, a freedom to ignore your feelings)

=== !

every performance problem can be solved by throwing more hardware +
(until there is no more hardware, or it doesn't scale anymore)

=== hey, clouds

=== illusion

it creates this illusion of infinite resources,

=== until the moment you log into billing console

== the lost of art of finding bottlenecks

performance becomes a thing we should all care about

=== let me put some light on the problem

=== !

we are living in a world of scarce resources

there is only X CPU instructions per cycle +
there is only X IOPS +
there is only X GB/s memory bus throughput


=== thesis

all performance problems are caused by lack of resources

=== !

you performance problems are either

* CPU bound
* "memory wall"
* IOPS bound
* network throughput bound

=== !

all performance problems are caused by lack of resources

=== I lied

=== contention

all performance problems +
are either caused  by +
lack of resources +
or resources shared between processes

=== !

what if would have simple set of rules +
(aka heuristics) +
that would help us navigate in this crazy world?

=== ! follow the rules

=== start from CPU

=== developer deploying new version during outage

=== !

trust your instincts

* check system load
* CPU usage chart

== USE

== the box

== benchmarking

== continous profiling
